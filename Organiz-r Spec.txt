File Spec:

SFFOLE files are JSON files with the following Schema:


[ /* Main Array of "Entries" */
  {
    "first property" : [
      "FP first value",
      "FP second value",
      "FP third value",
      (...)
      /* As many Values as desired... */
    ],
    "second property" : [
    ],
    (...)
    /* As many Properties as desired...
    ...determined by Add/Remove Buttons in Header Row */
  }, 
  (...)
  /* As many Entries as desired...
  ... All Entries will have the same 'Properties'...
  ... added across all Entries (intialized empty) via the "Blank Property Field"*/
]

Functionality Details:

"Header Row + Data Rows" is referred to as 'The Grid'
Original State of The Grid is an unpopulated Header Row, with only the Blank Property Text Field displayed, and no Data Rows. The Grid is also greyed-out.
Only options (and active buttons) are 'New', 'Open', and 'Exit'.

[1] New File will create new SFFOLE JSON data in memory with [X] Properties and [X] Entries, open a File Explorer 'Save' prompt, and write that SFFOLE data to a JSON document at the provided destination.
Then, SFFOLE will open that newly-created document.

[2] Open File used to select target JSON file.
If data is present in File is congruent with SFFOLE spec, file will open and extract File's SFFOLE-compatible JSON data to the browser JS memory.
Errors in opening file are displayed in a popup, opening fails, back to Original State.

[3] Exit will save current SFFOLE data to target file and exit the browser.

[4] No further details required. See summary description note above.

[5] Once Entered, SFFOLE will iterate over each Entry, and add the entered property onto it.

[6] Delete Button deletes entire Entry.

[7] Pressing 'X' in X-Button removes value from target Array Property of target Entry.

[8] Pressing '+' next to text-entry field adds entered value to target Array Property of target Entry.
